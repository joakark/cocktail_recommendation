### Cocktail Recommendation

In this analysis, I am:

* Scraping cocktail information from the web, and
* Creating a simple algorithm that finds cocktails that are similar to each other based on their ingredients. 

The main code is located in the **cocktail_scraping_and_recommendation.ipynb** notebook.

The end goal is to create a cocktail recommendation engine.
